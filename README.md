## Documentation

* The quiz is scored. The application must store multiple players' scores and identifying information 
so that players can compare their results with each other. 

* The user has a limited amount of time to complete the quiz. The countdown timer is initiated when the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button.

* When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked the user will be presented with the first in a series of multiple choice questions. When a question is answered the user is automatically presented with another question.

* Each incorrect answer will result in a ten second deduction from the players remaining time limit. 

* The game is over when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero.

* When the game is over the player is able to save their initials and score.
